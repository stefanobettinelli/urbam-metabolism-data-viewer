# A UI for downloading air pollution data collected by the "Urban Metabolism" platform (React + Redux)
####
Urban Metabolism is an opensource project that I'm working on as a research fellow and a fullstack developer
at CNR Bologna, it consists of a set of distributed IoT devices that collects air data (in mobility)
which are capable of sending them to our backend system, at later stages tha data are processed
with ML techniques.
